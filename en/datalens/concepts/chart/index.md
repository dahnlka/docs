# Charts

_Charts_ are the visualization of data from a dataset in the form of a table, diagram, or map.

{{ datalens-short-name }} includes two types of charts:

* [Dataset-based charts](#dataset-based-charts)
* [QL charts](#sql-charts)

## Dataset-based charts {#dataset-based-charts}

Charts are created in a wizard based on data from one or more datasets (see [multi-dataset charts](#multi-dataset-charts)).
You can create an unlimited number of charts based on a single dataset.

The workspace in the wizard interface is divided into three main panels:
1. A dataset panel where available fields are displayed: **Dimensions** and **Measures**. You can add a [calculated field](../calculations/index.md) to the list.
1. A visualization setup panel that you can use to select a [chart type](../../visualization-ref/index.md). Each type has its own set of sections (such as X-axis, Y-axis, and filters) where you can drag and drop fields. For more information, see [{#T}](settings.md).
1. A preview panel where the visualization is displayed.

Charts let you quickly analyze and test hypotheses. You can also save charts and add them to dashboards as widgets.

{% note warning %}

{{ datalens-short-name }} limits the number of data rows displayed in charts. For more information, see [{#T}](../limits.md).

{% endnote %}

### Multi-dataset charts {#multi-dataset-charts}

Multi-dataset charts display data from multiple datasets.

Queries for each dataset are processed independently of each other. You cannot create calculated fields from fields in multiple datasets.
When you add a second {{ datalens-short-name }} dataset, a link is automatically created based on the first match for the field name and field data type.

In this case, you can:

* Change links.
* Add new links.
* Delete links.

{% note info %}

Datas in a chart don't have to be linked.

{% endnote %}

Features of working with linked datasets in charts, except for geochart layers:

* One chart can use any measures from datasets, regardless of their links.
* One chart can only use linked dimensions.
* Filters by linked dimensions are applied to all datasets.
* Filters by non-linked dimensions are applied only to their own dataset.

Features of working with linked datasets in geovisualizations on different layers:

* A geolayer can use any measures from datasets regardless of their links
* A geolayer can only use its linked dimensions.
* Filters by linked dimensions from the **General filters** section are applied to all datasets in all layers.
* Filters from the **General filters** section that use non-linked dimensions only apply to their own dataset in all layers.
* Filters in the **Layer filters** section that use linked dimensions apply to all datasets within the current layer.
* Filters in the **Layer filters** section that use non-linked dimensions only apply to their own dataset within the current layer.
* There are no restrictions on using non-linked dimensions in different layers.

## QL charts {#sql-charts}


_QL charts_ are charts created from a connection if the connection source is a database. Use a SQL query to build these charts. The query is run using the source database's SQL dialect, which helps expand visualization capabilities by using database-specific transactions.


Running a query does not create a separate [Dataset](../dataset/index.md) object: a chart is generated on the fly and displayed in the preview panel.

Unlike [dataset-based charts](#dataset-based-charts), the logic of a visualization area in QL charts favors queries against the source, that is, the visualization area only displays the data queried.


QL charts:

* Reduce database workload by using direct queries.
* Are only suitable for `SELECT` queries.
* Enable the use of `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `SORT BY` queries and aggregate functions in SQL queries.
* Enable the parameterization of any part of a SQL query.
* Support a limited set of [visualizations types](../../visualization-ref/index.md).
* They do not support [RLS](../../security/row-level-security.md) and [calculated fields](../calculations/index.md).

{% include [datalens-sql-ch-example](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-sql-ch-example.md) %}


To create a QL chart, see the [instructions](../../operations/chart/create-sql-chart.md).

## Chart types {#chart-types}

You can find all the {{ datalens-full-name }} chart types in the [Visualization reference](../../visualization-ref/index.md).



## Versioning {#versioning}

Chart versioning is the ability to store the history of chart configuration changes using versions. A list of versions is available to users with the lowest level of **{{ permission-read }}** access to the chart.

{% note info %}

Currently, versioning is only supported for [dataset-based](#dataset-based-charts) charts.

{% endnote %}

To go to the list of versions, click the ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) icon at the top of the screen and select **Change history**.

![image](../../../_assets/datalens/concepts/version-list.png)

To select a version from the list, click it. The version number will be displayed as the value of the `revId` parameter in the chart address string. Clicking on a link with the version number in the `revId` parameter will open the relevant version of the chart directly.

### Version types {#version-types}

The following distinct versions are available:

* **Actual**. The most recently saved version of a chart. All users can see chart versions on dashboards, as well as when directly navigating to charts or opening them for editing from the dashboard context menu. Only one version of a chart can be actual.

  ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/concepts/current-version.png)

  If a user has **{{ permission-write }}** permissions, they can make any chart version actual.

  {% note warning %}

  When updating any version, except a draft, a new chart version is created.

  {% endnote %}

* **Draft**. A version with unsaved chart changes. The main users do not see changes being made to a draft. This enables you to hide chart edits until a version update. A chart can only have one draft.

  ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/concepts/draft-version.png)

  To create a draft after editing a chart, click the down arrow in the upper-right corner and select **Save as draft**.

* **Not actual**. A version that is neither actual nor a draft.

  ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/concepts/old-version.png)

{% note tip %}

You can share any chart version by adding the `revId` parameter to the chart link, e.g., `?revId=zac5m4edoaqqr`.

{% endnote %}

### Creating a new version {#version-create}

A new version is automatically created when you click **Save and make actual** in chart edit mode. Here are the chart configuration changes that result in a new version:

* Changing chart settings that can be accessed by clicking ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/gear.svg) at the top of the screen.
* Adding, renaming, or deleting chart fields.
* Adding or deleting fields in chart sections.

### Limitations {#restrictions}

* The change history only contains a list of chart versions and includes: version type, save date and time, and the author of the edits.
* Chart versions don't include changes to access permissions (this operation is performed separately from chart edits).
* Versions do not display a list of changes. You can only view the saved status of the chart configuration.





## Publishing a chart {#public-access}

You can grant any internet user access to a chart using [{{ datalens-public }}](../datalens-public.md). This chart becomes public and any user can view it without authorization.

Granting public access to a chart increases the number of DB queries, so keep in mind that the load on the database will increase.

To grant public access to a chart:

{% include [share-note](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-share-note.md) %}

1. On the navigation page, find the chart and open it.
1. At the top of the wizard interface, click ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/share.svg).
1. In the window that opens, enable **Access via link**. {{ datalens-short-name }} automatically grants access to related objects.
1. Copy the public link and click **Apply**.




## Access management {#access-management}

You can configure chart permissions.

To configure chart permissions:

{% include [manage-access](../../../_includes/datalens/operations/datalens-chart-manage-access.md) %}

For more information about types of permissions, see [{#T}](../../security/index.md).
