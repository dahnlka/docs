# Integration with messengers

By using messengers, you can quickly notify your employees about important events. If a messenger has an API, you can use {{ tracker-name }} to set up a trigger that sends HTTP requests to the messenger API when certain events occur. For example, this might be handy when a severe error occurs in your queue.

Let's look at how we can set up triggers that send notifications to:

- [Slack](slack.md)
- [Telegram](telegram.md)
