# Finding issues by key or name

If you know the name of an issue or its key, you can search for it using the search bar or query language.

{% list tabs %}

- Web interface

   
   * Use the search bar.

      On the left panel, open ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/tasks.svg) **Issues** and enter your search query in the **Search by issue name** field.

   * Use the [query language](query-filter.md).

      Open the [**Issue** page]({{ link-tracker }}issues) and in the upper-right corner, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/query-language.svg) **Query language**.

      Enter your query in the query string. Use the following parameters in the query:

      * `Key`: to search for an issue by the exact key value.
      * `Summary`: to search for an issue by [name](query-filter.md#query-text).


- Mobile app

   At the top of the screen, enter the issue name or key in the **Search by all issues** field. As a result, you'll see a list with the issues that meet the query criteria. The list shows the first 20 entries. If you didn't find the issue you need, refine your query.

{% endlist %}
